With the increasing varsities of websites' contents, video is an essential and common medium. Unlike the traditional video technique, which downloads the video first, video streaming is widely used to deliver high-quality and real-time videos. Just in one year from 2018 to 2019, the video streaming views rose to 72\%\cite{streaming2019statics}. Video streaming transfers videos as a continuous data stream and enables the users to playback before the whole video is delivered\cite{sun2007overview}, which provides the benefit of low delay and low storage demands. The most popular video streaming communications form is broadcasting, also known as one-to-all, where the video data is transferred to all the recipients simultaneously.

Two main challenges of video steaming broadcasting are i) reducing end-to-end latency and ii) achieving scalability. End-to-end latency refers to the total time of data transmission across the network from source to destination. Low latency is crucial for communication, especially in interactive applications such as online multiplayer gaming, and video conferencing. The information in interactive applications is useful only with a time limit, which depends on the application but often is on the order of 150 ms\cite{apostolopoulos2002video}.   WebRTC is one of the state-of-art real-time communication technology between browsers or mobile applications without third-party software or plugins\cite{sredojev2015webrtc}. One of the main advantages of WebRTC is the low latency of under a half second, which makes WebRTC a promising solution for low-latency video streaming.

Scalability is a property of a system that maintains the same performance while increasing the number of users by adding new resources to the system. A scalable service is essential for video streaming, especially when the content is worldwide popular. The 2019 Coachella achieved 82.9 million live views, which required the system to scale up in a short time but still with stable service quality\cite{coachella2019views}. Besides scaling up, scaling down is a necessary property that allows the system to release resources when the demands are low to save cost.

In this work, we propose a scalable video streaming service based on WebRTC broadcast with low latency.  The rest of this article is organized as follows. First, we give a brief overview of the background of our project in Section \ref{background}. In Section \ref{approach}, we introduce our approach in more detail, followed by the evaluation in Section \ref{evulation}. Then the limitations and future work of our system are discussed accordingly in Section \ref{limitations} and Section \ref{future_work}. Finally, the conclusion is given in Section \ref{conclusion}.
